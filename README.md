# AutiOvis

AutiOvis is an easy to use Android application which demonstrates ViewPager and TTS all in one.
You can add pictures with title as a new page and switch between pages by swype. Tap on each picure says its title.
Currently only Google TTS is used.

Todo, plans:
- Add Samsung TTS support
- Add Pico TTs support
- Add TTS engin settings support
- Check whether already added image still exists on storage before reload it to page
- Add search ability between pages based on title (or order? )

# AutiOvis

AutiOvis is an easy to use Android application which demonstrates ViewPager and TTS all in one.
You can add pictures with title as a new page and switch between pages by swype. Tap on each picure says its title.
Currently only Google TTS is used.

Feature request:
- create categories and let's make possible to add related pictures to the category (implemented, no pictures yet)
- set the maximum number of pictures
- take new picture with camera directly from AutiOvis
- remove already added pictore
- record own voice and assign it to a picture
- Check whether already added image still exists on storage before reload it to page
- Add search ability between pages based on title (or order? )
